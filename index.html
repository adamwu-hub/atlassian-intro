        <p class="content-header">Greetings, Atlassian team!</p>
  
        <p class="content-body">
          I am thrilled to join you as a Senior Software Engineer in the Provisioning Core team. My name is Adam, and I’m excited to embark on this new journey with all of you.
        </p>
  
        <p class="content-body">
          For the past 12 years, I have been with the Commonwealth Bank, where I honed my skills and developed a deep passion for software engineering. Originally from China, my wife and I moved to Australia in 2005, and we’ve made a happy home here in the inner west of Sydney with our three wonderful children: one daughter and two sons.
        </p>
  
        <p class="content-body">
          Outside of work, I have a range of interests that keep me inspired and energised. I'm a big fan of the action-packed films of Bruce Willis and have a deep love for sci-fi stories and manga. I also enjoy watching and playing soccer, have a soft spot for classic songs, which provide the perfect backdrop to my coding sessions.
        </p>
  
        <p class="content-body">
          I look forward to collaborating with all of you and contributing to the innovative spirit of Atlassian. Here’s to a fantastic new chapter!
